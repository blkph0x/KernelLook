Define a new IOCTL code for retrieving hook information. For example:
cpp
Copy code
#define IOCTL_GET_HOOKS CTL_CODE(FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN, 0x802, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_ANY_ACCESS)
Extend the HOOK_INFO structure to store relevant information about each hook. You may include fields such as hook type, hooking function address, original function address, and any other relevant details.

In the driver's dispatch routine (DispatchIoctl), add a new case for the IOCTL_GET_HOOKS code. Within this case, perform the following steps:

a. Validate the input buffer size and ensure it is large enough to hold at least one HOOK_INFO structure.

b. Retrieve the process ID from the input buffer.

c. Obtain a handle to the target process using the process ID. You can use the PsLookupProcessByProcessId function.

d. Enumerate the modules loaded in the target process to identify potential hooks. You can leverage the LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY structure to iterate through the loaded modules.

e. For each module, inspect the memory regions and look for common hooking patterns or known hooking techniques. This can involve analyzing code modifications, detours, hooking libraries, or other hooking mechanisms.

f. If a hook is found, populate a HOOK_INFO structure with the relevant information and add it to an output buffer.

g. Copy the filled output buffer to the user-mode application's output buffer.

In the user-mode application, update the logic to send the new IOCTL command (IOCTL_GET_HOOKS) to the driver and handle the response. Extend the application to receive and process the hook information retrieved from the driver.
